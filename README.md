### Entertain the Crew ###

In our project, we have three types of Tic Tac Toe game variants:
1. Human vs. AI Tic Tac Toe 
2. Human vs. Human Tic Tac Toe
3. Human vs. AI Misere Tic Tac Toe

We have used the **minimax** algorithm with **depth-wise difficulty** and optimization using **alpha-beta pruning**. 
**Hints** are also accessible to the human if required.
**Misere** tic tac toe tweaks the minimax algorithm to make a variation of the game. 

Hope you enjoy!
